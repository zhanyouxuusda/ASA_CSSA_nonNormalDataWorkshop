##  Outline of the analysis
### 1. Test Normality with Shapiro.test
### 2. Multi-way ANOVA with type I, II and III SS
### 3. whole-split plot analysis 
### 4. Generalized linear model (glm) with Gaussian distribution
### 5. Generalized linear model (glm) with Poisson distribution
### 6. Generalized linear model (glm) with binomial distribution
### 7. Generalized linear mixed model (glmm) with Poisson distribution
### 8. Generalized linear mixed model (glmm) with Binomial distribution
### 9. Generalized linear mixed model (glmm) with whole-split plot analysis 

###  Recommended model:treat Treatment and Cultivar as fixed effects, and plot, replicates as random effecs. glmer(standCount_all/1000~ (1|plot) + T *  C + (1|R), weights = n,data = p.data, family='binomial')

## Normality test with Shapiro test

```{r}

# the survival rate of the data is normal with a p-value of 0.1217

shapiro.test(p.data$count)

# the survival count of survived plants is normal with a p-value of 0.122

# KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV, ks test
# The Kolmogorov D statistic is used to assess whether a random sample was drawn from a specified distribution. Although it is frequently used to test for normality, the statistic is "distribution free" in the sense that it compares the empirical distribution to any specified distribution. Link: https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2020/06/24/kolmogorov-d-distribution-exact.html#:~:text=The%20Kolmogorov%20D%20statistic%20is%20used%20to%20assess,compares%20the%20empirical%20distribution%20to%20any%20specified%20distribution.

# The KS test is a non-parametric and distribution-free test: It makes no assumption about the distribution of data. The KS test is used to compare a sample with a reference probability distribution, or to compare two samples. The KS test is used to evaluate: Null Hypothesis: The samples do indeed come from P. link: https://r4dn.com/what-is-the-difference-between-kolmogorov-smirnov-and-shapiro-wilk-2/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20difference%20between%20Kolmogorov-Smirnov%20and%20Shapiro-Wilk%3F,rejects%20the%20null%20hypothesis%20of%20normality%20less%20often%29.


# Compare survival rate to a normal distribution
ks.test(p.data$survivalRate, 'pnorm')
# Compare survival plant counts to a Poisson distribution
ks.test(p.data$standCount_all, 'ppois', lambda= mean(p.data$standCount_all))
# Compare survival rate to a binomial distribution
ks.test(p.data$survivalRate, 'pbinom', size=24, prob=mean(p.data$survivalRate))

# Shapiro test--> normal
# ks.test --> not normal, not binomial, close to Poisson distribution

## type I SS, p-value changes with different order of the variables in the ANOVA. Type I SS are order-dependent (hierarchical) . Each effect is adjusted for all other effects that appear earlier in the model, but not for any effects that appear later in the model. 

res_anova3_CTY= aov(S~ C + T + Y3 + R , data = p.data)

## type II SS
## type II SS are the reduction in the SSE as a result of
## adding the effect to a model that contains all other
## effects except effects that contain the effect being
## tested. An effect is contained in another effect if
## it can be derived by deleting terms in that effect.

## type III SS
## Type III SS are identical to those of Type II SS when the design is balanced. When the design is unbalanced, these are the SS that are approximated by the traditional unweighted means ANOVA that uses harmonic mean sample sizes to adjust cell totals.
